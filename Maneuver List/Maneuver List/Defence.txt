Block|(1)|0|(1)|(2)|0|(1)|0|(2)|0|0|(1)|This is the most basic of defenses used to halt or deflect an incoming attack. Where game mechanics are concerned, Blocking works essentially the same as any Parry, except that it uses the shield’s DTN.

Block is the one exception to the rule that a character may only execute one Maneuver per Exchange, as it may be combined with a Parry if both weapon and shield are wielded. In this case, the DTN for Blocking is increased by +1 for using the off-hand. Otherwise, Blocking with a designated shield in the off-hand does not increase DTN.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Block Open & Strike|(2)|1|(2)|(3)|-|(2)|1|(3)|1|1|(2)|This Maneuver consists of Blocking or Parrying an incoming attack in an open manner in order to use a second (usually the primary) weapon to attack the new opening. In an Exchange, defend with either a normal Block or Parry, but declare Block Open & Strike alongside this defense and pay its Activation Cost. In the event of a successful defense, the follow-up attack in the subsequent Exchange may be executed with bonus dice equal to this Maneuver’s Quality of Success.|This Maneuver is available at Proficiency level 4.|Counter|(2)|1|2|3|-|2|(3)|(3)|(3)|3/2|(3)|Though primarily an offensive action, Counters are initiated by the defender. Sometimes called a Riposte, a Counter relies on receiving an opponent’s attack and using it against him. There are literally hundreds or even thousands of Counters, designed to deal with almost any attack from any direction.

When a defender declares Counter as his chosen defense he spends this Maneuver’s Activation Cost and then allocates dice as in any standard Parry. If the defender fails the Parry, his Counter also fails and he is hit. If the Parry is successful with a QoS of at least 1, so is the Counter, and the defender assumes the role of aggressor as normal. He receives bonus dice on his counterattack equal to the number of Successes that were rolled in the attack successfully defended with the Counter.

Additionally, due to the myriad nature of Counters, the countering party should roll on Table 3.3 to determine the exact effect of his Counter (note that Counters with light, fencing-style blades use the Half-sword column of the Table).

No Activation Cost for countering Maneuvers derived from this table need be paid, but Activation Costs for Reach differences and those singular to the weapon used have to be paid.  If the countering attack changes the engagement range of the combatants, the countering party may decide whether to return to the previous engagement range once the Counter is concluded, or to remain at the new one.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Disarm|5|3|4|3|-|3|3|4|(5)|3|4|Disarming is a popular Maneuver when you are trying to avoid hurting your opponent or trying to make him surrender, but it can just as easily be used as a prelude to an easy kill. Disarms may be performed as an attack or a defense.

As a defense the Disarm Maneuver is performed in a similar manner to a Parry. Perfect timing is required, as the defender must wait for the attack to come and sweep his attacker’s weapon aside at the optimal moment, twisting it out of his hands. Unlike other defenses, Disarm incurs a Reach penalty, such as an offense, if it is attempted against longer weapons, but only half the usual ones (0.50 rounds up). After the Activation Cost has been paid, dice are assigned as if for a Parry. If the defense is successful, the attacker must make a Knockdown Check with a Difficulty equal to the defender’s Quality of Success.

Failure in the Knockdown Check means that the attacker has instead been disarmed. Whether the attacker drops his weapon or not, the defender now takes initiative. Of course, if the attacker wins, then the Disarm attempt has failed and the attack goes through (minus the defender’s QoS, as usual).|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 3.|Evasion|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|This is the Maneuver of avoiding an attack by moving out of its way. If Evasion is chosen as a Defensive Maneuver, any number of Evasions are possible during the Exchange, provided that dice from the MP are set aside for each individual Evasion.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Expulsion|(3)|2|(3)|2|-|2|2|2|(2)|2|(4)|This Maneuver is not dissimilar to the offensive Beat, but is initiated by the defender’s side. It is only effective against Thrusts and Thrust-based attacks, or against Slash-based attacks made with 4 dice or less.

To execute an Expulsion, simply declare “Expulsion” alongside the standard Parry, pay this Maneuver’s Activation Cost, and allocate dice to the Parry as usual. The effects are nearly identical to those of an offensive Beat. If the Parry fails, then the round is resolved normally. If the Parry is effective, then all Maneuvers utilizing the weapon that was successfully expulsed receive a penalty equal to the defender’s Quality of Success, applicable in the Exchange immediately following the Expulsion.|This Maneuver is available at Proficiency Level 3.|Grapple|1|1|1|2|-|2|(2)|(3)|(3)|(2)|0|The basics of this Maneuver are governed by many Proficiencies. It consists of grabbing the opponent, removing any weapon he wields, and changing the bout from free-flowing combat into a wrestling match, with the purpose of immobilizing the opponent, throwing him to the ground or breaking his limb.

The Activation Costs assume that the Grapple Maneuver is launched against an opponent’s limb, specifically the primary attacking limb.  In this instance (and only then), it may be targeted against other parts of the body, for instance the torso or the head, but its Activation Cost is in this case increases by +1. Used defensively against any attack other than an unarmed one, the Activation Cost is increased by a further +1. Finally, Reach modifiers apply to defensive use of the Maneuver, which of course has a Reach range of Hand.

The Grapple’s TN is 7.  If the Maneuver is successful, a hit is not only avoided, but a hold on the opponent’s weapon arm is also established.  The defending grappler is now the agressor, and the opponent’s attack is merely tied (unless Grapple was used as defense against another Grapple, in which case a tie establishes no clinch and the roles of aggressor and defender remain unchanged). After a successful Grapple both combatants find themselves in a clinch at the Reach range of Hand.

Until the clinch is broken both must use MP dice from their Wrestling Proficiency. Should the clinch be entered mid-Round when another Proficiency – one other than Wrestling - was being used in the first Exchange, the MP is recalculated for the second Exchange based on Wrestling Proficiency, with dice spent in the first Exchange subtracted from the Wrestling MP.

Once the clinch is established, the aggressor, receiving his QoS in executing the initial Grapple Maneuver as bonus dice for his subsequent MP, now has several options, which are presented in the Grapple Options tab.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Half Sword|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|This is one of the few practical ways to kill an armored opponent in full harness (full plate) with a sword.  Used with long swords, hand-and-a-half swords, and other longer weapons, the Half-Sword technique is performed by grasping the blade of the sword with the off (usually left) hand in order to use the sword as a short spear or pole-weapon. This technique is particularly useful in close-quarters when swinging a long weapon may be impractical.

Half-Swording reduces a sword’s effective Reach by one or two steps from Long to Medium or Short, at the player’s discretion. Note that the Half-Sword may be released into a one-handed attack at any time, nullifying any Half-Sword bonuses, but gaining Reach.

Half-Swording precludes the sword being used for slashing, but it increases control over the weapon and thus lowers both DTN and Thrust ATN by 1. The latter effectively increases damage dealt, but against any type of armor Half-Swording it also raises the Thrust DR by +1.

One can shift from normal grip to the Half-Sword at any time, though doing so during an Exchange (shifting suddenly into or out of the Half-Sword in order to execute a particular counter, for example) costs 1 MP.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Master Strike|(5)|4|(6)|3|-|3|(6)|(6)|(6)|4|(6)|The jewel of the art of fighting is the Master-Strike, a type of attack that both defends and offends in one motion.  The technique, as it applies to Blade, can be used either as an offensive or defensive Maneuver. In many ways it resembles the Simultaneous Block/Strike Maneuver, however it involves only one weapon.

As a Defense, declare a Master-Strike as your defense or alongside a Parry, and pay the Activation Cost. Split this Exchange’s dice into offense and defense. Roll the defense first, as your opponent attacks. If your defense is successful, carry the dice in your Quality of Success over into the offensive roll! Should your defense fail, regardless of offensive or defensive role, the attack also fails, and all dice assigned to it are lost.|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 10.|Overrun|3|2|2|2|-|2|3/2|3|3|2|(4)|An Overrun is a highly specialized and demanding Maneuver, similar in concept to a Master-Strike, but it is more limited than the latter. It combines a defense and an attack in the same action, in the same Exchange, and involves evading an opponent’s blow while at the same time launching an attack of your own.

After paying the Activation Cost for the Maneuver, the player assigns dice to its defensive and offensive actions. The defensive action is an Evasion, rolled against TN 8 like a Partial Evasion. Any additional Activation Cost from Encumbrance, if these optional rules are being used, must be paid as well, out of the dice assigned to the defense.

If the Evasion is successful (QoS 0+), the dice assigned to the offensive part of the Overrun are now used to launch an immediate Bash, Cut, or Thrust against the opponent. Any Activation Cost for this Offensive Maneuver, including Reach penalties, must be paid as well, out of the dice assigned to the offense.  Any positive QoS from the Evasion carries over into the offensive part of the Maneuver as bonus dice.

If the Evasion is unsuccessful, the offensive part of the Overrun goes ahead anyway, but any damage is determined before the Overrunning character’s attack roll, and its consequences are applied in full, including Shock penalties and any possible Knockdown.

A combatant carrying out a successful Overrun as his defense may assume the role of aggressor, unless the attacker inflicted a higher wound level on the Overrunner, than the Overrunner inflicted on the Attacker, in which case the attacker remains the aggressor. In any case the Overrun leaves the combatants at the engagement range of the Reach of the weapon of the combatant who emerges as the aggressor.|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 8.|Parry|0|0|0|0|-|0|1|0|1|1/0|(1)|This Maneuver is the basis for all non-shield non-dodging defenses. It consists primarily of using one’s own weapon to deflect - not halt - an incoming attack. Parries are performed by simply rolling defense with the DTN of the weapon at hand as the normal Opposed check of a combat Exchange.

If a combatant is wielding two weapons, one in each hand, this Maneuver allows him to deflect two attacks, one with each weapon. To do so, he assigns dice from his MP in any proportion to either Parry. Remember that actions with a weapon in the off hand are at +1 TN.|This Maneuver is available at all Proficiency levels.|Quick Draw|(4)|2|1|(4)|-|(3)|(4)|(4)|(4)|2|(4)|Characters using this maneuver can attack with a Cut, Bash, or Parry with any weapon of Medium Reach or shorter. Because the curvature of a weapon makes this Maneuver easier, straight-bladed or hafted weapons of Medium or longer Reach require an additional 1 MP over the normal Activation Cost. Weapons with a Reach of Hand and Short need no such curvature, and can be quick-drawn with no penalty.

Weapons of Long Reach and shorter can also benefit from this Maneuver by making a sudden thrusting attack with the pommel or butt end of the weapon. This has no additional cost, but its statistics differ than the parent weapons Reach Hand, Thrust ATN 6, and DR –1 Blunt.

In all cases, the weapon being quick-drawn is assumed to be at the hip or in some other very accessible place.  For those weapons carried in less accessible places - such as a boot knife or short weapon over the shoulder -add 1 MP to the Activation Cost (compounding with any other penalties or modifiers). Weapons in packs or other immediately inaccessible places are just that: inaccessible.

To perform this Maneuver in play simply declare which weapon is being quick-drawn at the beginning of any Exchange (usually the first, but not necessarily), and state whether it is being used to Cut, Bash, or Parry.  After spending the Activation Cost and allowing for any penalties, a Terrain Check is made against the weapons normal ATN -1 (if the drawing hand is free) or ATN -2 (if the drawing hand is on the weapon’s grip already).  If this Terrain Check is successful, the attack or Parry goes forward normally, using standard attack and defense rules. If this Terrain Check fails, the character is forced to use some form of Evasion or get hit. The weapon will be free for the next Exchange.

This Maneuver can be combined with the rules for initiative (and stealing it. Likewise, don’t forget to use Reach rules here, including those rules for getting inside of a weapon’s Reach, or this Maneuver will lose much of its bite).|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 4.|Rota|(2)|1|(2)|2|-|2|2|3|3|2|(3)|The Rota is a riposte maneuver. The back edge of the blade is used to deflect an opposing attack, after which an immediate cut with the forward edge is performed. The weapon is not moved far, and as such, the location of the counter attack is fixed. This maneuver is only available against swinging (Cleaving or Blunt) attacks, and the counter attack must be a Cleaving or blunt swinging attack, not a thrust.

The Rota is similar to the Counter Maneuver with the same benefit for success (the attacker’s successes as bonus dice for the counter attack the following exchange). However, instead of the random location of the counter attack, the Rota counter attacks the same Target Zone on the opponent that he originally targeted on the character.|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 2.|Winding & Binding|(4)|1|(2)|1|-|1|(3)|(3)|(3)|2|(3)|Winding & Binding is a deadly game that results when two weapons clash and stick together for a time. While declared as a standard Parry, the Activation Cost of both Maneuvers must be paid. If the Parry fails, the defender is struck as normal. However, if it is successful, the Winding & Binding comes into play, with an opponent’s weapon not deflected, but instead collected on the defender’s sword, both weapons sticking together.

Even if the defender merely ties the attacker, the initiative passes to him and he receives the Quality of Success of his Winding & Binding defense as bonus dice for his counterattack from the bind in the subsequent Exchange.  The nature of this follow-up attack, which has no Activation Cost, is somewhat random. It is the result of the shoving and winding match of the two combatants locked together, each trying to either disengage or strike past his foe’s defending weapon.

While a Thrust past an opponent’s guard is the most likely outcome, it is by no means the only one possible. To determine the actual form of the follow-up attack, the initiator of the Winding & Binding rolls 1D6 on the table in the following tab.

The combatant winds into an advantageous position for an attack. The Winding & Binding continues into the next Exchange without change of aggressors, but with twice this Exchange’s QoS as bonus dice for the current aggressor, any or all of which may also be used as a + / - modifier for the D6 roll on the table shown on the next tab.

Winding & Binding changes the engagement range. All attacks happen at optimum Reach for the attacker, this now being the new engagement range.

The defender has the choice of three defenses, as shown in the tables tab.|This maneuver is available at Proficiency level 5.
