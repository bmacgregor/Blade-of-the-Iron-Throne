These files are read-in at compile time and added as class-objects to
the Character Creator.  Originally, this had been handled in a much less
elegant fashion, with just a ton of massive lists, but I feel that my
previous approach felt pretty clunky.  Below is a breakdown for how each
file is set up for reading-in - keep in mind, the '|' character is used as
a splitter, and the newline is used for different objects.  Unless otherwise
stated, all enums are zero-based:

---------------------

Arcane_Secrets.txt
[Secret Name]|[first enumerated int for mystery prereq]|[second enumerated int for mystery prereq]|[Description]
  
  The enum used is structured as follows:
    { none, goety, necromancy, cursing, enslavement, mending, prophecy, scrying, witchfire }

  [int to determine if the asset has a poor version (zero or one]|
