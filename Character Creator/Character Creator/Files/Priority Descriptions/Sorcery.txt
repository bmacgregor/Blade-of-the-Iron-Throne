Mysteriarch: one of the greatest masters of the arcane alive. He can know all Mysteries, both Lesser and Greater, and he starts out the game with knowledge of a single Arcane Secret. He receives one free point in the Occultism Skill and one free Proficiency point to spend on Mysteries, but may not put more Proficiency points into Greater than into Lesser Mysteries.
Sorcerer: denotes somebody deeply steeped and well versed in arcane knowledge. He can know either all six Lesser Mysteries, or three Lesser and one Greater Mystery. He receives one free point in the Occultism Skill. Should he opt for a Greater Mystery, it may be of no greater value than his highest Lesser Mystery.
Dabbler: encompasses hedge wizards, witch doctors, sages of secret lore, some of the more devoted cultists of unwholesome deities and other serious meddlers in the occult. Such characters may know up to two Lesser Mysteries and may also have the Occultism Skill. Enslavement and Witchfire may not both be chosen.
Mundane: the common man. He has heard whispers of sorcery but has most likely never encountered it, has no affinity for it, and most certainly doesn’t know any.
Cursed: a person not only unskilled in the arcane, but also somehow particularly vulnerable to harmful sorcery. When he checks to resist sorcerous harm or influence, he does so at a +2 TN penalty.
Doomed: a person not only devastatingly open to harmful sorcery, but actually victimized by it. He resists sorcery at a +2 TN penalty, and on top of this has already contracted some kind of terrible supernatural doom or weird. This doom hanging over him is geared toward a specific, utterly ruinous fate.
