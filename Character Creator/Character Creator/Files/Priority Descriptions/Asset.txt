Assets are aspects of a character’s personality, background, or physique, that make him better at some activities and worse at others, depending on which portion of the Asset is being explored. In addition to their mechanical effects, Assets suggest characteristics about the character’s personality that might lead to interesting role-playing opportunities. Assets offer a way for game mechanics to encourage deeper character backgrounds and more consistent role-playing.
